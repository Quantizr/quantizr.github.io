The general idea represented in the article remains. The main change with 3.0 is that non-visible blocks are not accessed at all by the mod, making the mod even less of a risk than before. Dungeon Rooms Mod v3.0 follows all the rules of the Hypixel network. It is worth noting that out of the 20k+ people who used Dungeon Rooms Mod v2.x, not a single one has been banned because of this mod.\nThe only rule where this mod lies in a gray area is the unfair advantage rule. However, what this mod does is essentially what your brain does when it enters a dungeon room. Your eyes see different blocks in the map, and your brain compares them with rooms you already know. Once your brain figures out what room you’re in, assuming you’ve memorized secrets, your brain can then tell you where the secrets are. This is what this mod does in code form. Unlike other solvers, such as experimentation table solvers (\u003e99% of humans cannot memorize the entire pattern of the experimentation table), memorizing and finding secrets is not beyond the ability of the average human, so comparatively, this mod arguably does not provide an unfair advantage over the average player.\nIf you still believe that secret waypoints are an unfair advantage, you can always disable them and view secret images instead (default hotkey for images is “O” as in Open).\nFeel free to read the old arguments, as many of them still apply. Just ignore anything involving block scanning since Dungeon Rooms Mod v3.0 only scans blocks within a player’s FOV, which is 100% allowed.\nDungeon Rooms Mod Links:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kr2M7WutgJ\nGithub: https://github.com/Quantizr/DungeonRoomsMod\nOverview/TL;DR Secret Waypoints for Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons have been added into Dungeon Rooms Mod with the release v2.0.0 on June 11th, 2021.\nBased on the general interpretation of Hypixel’s rules, the Dungeon Rooms Mod’s Secret Waypoints are not bannable This mod does not modify packets in any way, so it is not detectable other than sending the mod ID to the server at login (all Forge mods do this) As with all mods on the Hypixel network, this mod is still use at your own risk There are some who interpret the rules differently and believe that waypoints are an unfair advantage. Note to admins: If there are any Hypixel admins reading this who disagree with my interpretation, please message my Discord _risk#2091, or my forums account, so we can discuss.\nBackground Info Before we begin, there are a few important things which you should note.\nThis mod is not an ESP, meaning it does not directly scan for secrets. The mod places secret waypoints is based on a set of static coordinates for each room. The mod then calculates a corner of that room and makes that the origin point, then does some mathematical magic to convert the relative coordinates into the actual coordinates where the waypoints are placed.\nThe list of static coordinates which the mod uses to place waypoints is available at this link.\nThis mod does not modify packets in any way, and is completely undetectable to Watchdog. There are exactly two ways the admins could ban a player for using this mod, if they do deem it disallowed (unlikely).\nI would like to reiterate that it is highly unlikely the admins would do these two things without warning.\nIf you stream, record, or otherwise screenshare yourself playing with waypoints enabled. If the admins blacklist the mod ID. Whenever a player using Forge mods connects to a server, it sends the server a list of the mods they are using, including Dungeon Rooms Mod. If the admins choose, they can ban anyone connecting to the server with a certain mod ID (this is how they security banned players using JED). IMO, it would be very irresponsible of the admins to do so, because players using v1 of this mod have the same mod ID but no Secret Waypoints, but would also be banned in the same group. Hypixel’s Allowed Modifications Rules Hypixel’s Allowed Modifications Guide can be found here As a summary of the above link, mods cannot do the following three things:\nThe mod cannot provide an unfair advantage. The mod cannot automate any player movement, gameplay, etc. The mod cannot modify or alter packets. This mod does not automate anything or alter packets, so this mod is safe based on the second and third guidelines. The first guideline regarding providing unfair advanatages is the most contentious.\nHowever, I would like to first draw attention to Experimentation Table Solvers, which the admin Dctr confirmed were allowed, as long as the solver did not automatically click for the player. Experimentation Table Solvers allow a player to memorize patterns far longer than what is humanly possible (e.g. 99.99% of humans will never be able to memorize a sequence of a length up to 49 in the Chronomatron addon without outside help). This is obviously an unfair advantage, but supposedly the admins allowed it because it didn’t modify packets or automate behavior, thus making it undetectable.\nOn the other hand, a player can memorize all secrets - in fact the majority of top dungeon players have indeed memorized secrets for every room. This alone makes the Dungeon Rooms Mod less of an unfair advantage than Experimentation solvers. Furthermore, players who memorized pathing for secrets will be able to find secrets faster than someone using waypoints, so this still gives competitive players who are not using this mod an advantage.\nAs with Experimentation Table solvers, the Dungeon Rooms Mod does not modify packets or automate behavior, so using the same logic the admins applied to Experimentation Table Solvers, Secret Waypoints should be allowed. If Secret Waypoints were to be disallowed, any mod that has Experimentation Table Solvers (DSM, NEU, Skytils, SBE) would all have to be disallowed by the same logic.\nSimon @ Hypixel’s Comments on Waypoints On June 3, 2020, Simon (the owner of Hypixel) replied to a tweet, confirming that waypoints in general were allowed on the Hypixel network.\nNot sure, I’m just usin what lunar offers xD\n— Epaxial (@EpaxiaI) May 29, 2020Not bannable, enjoy\n— Simon @ Hypixel (@Simon_Hypixel) June 4, 2020 Following this, Youtubers such as ThirtyVirus began using waypoints for Fairy Souls. Soon after, popular mods such as Moulberry’s NEU (60k+ members in their Discord) added Fairy Soul Waypoints to their mod. Their waypoints work by dynamically checking what island type a player is on, then displaying the corresponding waypoints for that island. The waypoint then disappears when the fairy soul is clicked.\nThis is incredibly similar to what Dungeon Rooms Mod’s Secret Waypoints do. The Secret Waypoints dynamically check what room a player is in, then display the corresponding waypoints for that room, with the waypoints disappearing when the secrets are clicked.\nSince Fairy Soul Waypoints have been confirmed as allowed, and since the Secret Waypoints in Dungeon Rooms Mod share many characteristics with Fairy Soul Waypoints, it follows that Dungeon Rooms Mod should also be allowed.\nFr0z3n’s QoL Modifications Guidelines On March 16, 2021, the Hypixel admin Fr0z3n posted Update to Disallowed Modifications - QoL Modifications, clarifying what was allowed and disallowing certain modifications.\nThe relevant part of the post is shown below: Most important is the line “These examples generally revolve around the manipulation of packets.” Dungeon Rooms Mod does not modify packets in any way. As such, this mod follows Fr0z3n’s QoL guidelines.\nAs for the individual points, this mod does not display invisible entities. The waypoints are based on hardcoded relative coordinates (see this), not entities which the player can’t see. Also, as stated earlier, the mod does not automate or change player movement, change actions, or cancel interactions, it only adds additional waypoints.\nThirtyVirus and Badlion Client Dev’s Opinions On May 29, 2021, ThirtyVirus did a stream titled “the LAST time I will be bad at dungeons”, in which he expressed his wishes for Secret Waypoints. As ThirtyVirus gets paid good money from Badlion, he is obligated to hate Forge mods such as this one, so he suggested to the Badlion devs that they add Secret Waypoints. ThirtyVirus then reads a conversation between Badlion Devs regarding whether Secret Waypoints would be allowed, which is clipped here.\nTranscript:\nBadlion Dev 1: it [Secret Waypoints] is allowed\nBadlion Dev 2: all the highlighting stuff and showing where to go?\nBadlion Dev 1: yep\nBadlion Dev 2: so why were we worried in the first place?\nBadlion Dev 1: because we weren’t sure, we didn’t get their approval until now\nOh, but SBE Dev said this was bannable!!! With the release of SkyblockExtras 2.0.5, the devs of SBE also included an interesting bolded statement. Seeing as Dungeon Rooms Mod is the only widely used mod that scans the top of the physical map, this is a very pointed statement directed at Dungeon Rooms Mod. (Just as a note for reference, the Dungeon Rooms Mod scans the top of the map for the sole purpose of detecting what room a player is in.)\nThere are a few problems with his statement. First of all, the claim that “Admins have also decided…” is not backed up by any public statement by the admins. Based on everything the admins have said publicly, along with all the rules, there is nothing that states that scanning blocks which are not visible to the player is disallowed in any way.\nThe second more interesting point, is that the SBE devs narrowed down what was disallowed to just “scanning the top of the physical map,” not just blocks which are not visible to the player. They cleverly omitted the fact that SBE scans for blocks (specifically pistons) which are invisible to the player for their water puzzle solver. If they choose to follow what the admins supposedly told them (and them alone), they should probably also disable their water puzzle solver.\nThe SBE dev also clarified on what specifically makes Secret Waypoints bannable. He claims that it would be “less bannable” if it could be done using visible blocks.\nWhy does where the mod scans for blocks matter? A player who has memorized rooms and secrets can look at a room and easily tell which room it is. Sure, the player can’t see the top of the map, but the player can tell just as easily what a particular room is just by looking at the room. It’s not like being able to see the top of the map would provide any advantage in being able to tell which room a player is in.\nIt was originally more straightforward to implement top of the map scanning for room detection. However, there is a relatively easy way to do room detection without scanning the top of the map. It would take about two weeks to implement, but would result in no noticeable difference to the player.\nDoes it really matter where the mod scans for blocks if it doesn’t affect the end result? Like seriously, I could spend two weeks of my time recoding the mod to not scan the top of the room and only use visible blocks, but, unless a player looks at the code, they literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.\nSummary Again, as with all mods on Hypixel, Dungeon Rooms Mod is use at your own risk. But, based on everything listed above, the Secret Waypoints within the Dungeon Rooms Mod are most likely not bannable.\nDungeon Rooms Mod Links:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kr2M7WutgJ\nGithub: https://github.com/Quantizr/DungeonRoomsMod\nFor the last time, if there are any Hypixel admins reading this who disagree with my interpretation, please message my Discord _risk#2091, or my forums account, so we can discuss.\nI am more than happy to change the scanning from top of the map to visible blocks, if you believe that it is necessary.\n","wordCount":"1993","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://quantizr.github.io/posts/is-it-bannable/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Quantizr","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://quantizr.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://quantizr.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Quantizr (Alt + H)">Quantizr</a>

ThirtyVirus then reads a conversation between Badlion Devs regarding whether Secret Waypoints would be allowed, which is clipped <a href=https://youtube.com/clip/UgxRUOo-C8eLMbiq3tl4AaABCQ>here</a>.<br>Transcript:</p><blockquote><p>Badlion Dev 1: it [Secret Waypoints] is allowed<br>Badlion Dev 2: all the highlighting stuff and showing where to go?<br>Badlion Dev 1: yep<br>Badlion Dev 2: so why were we worried in the first place?<br>Badlion Dev 1: because we weren&rsquo;t sure, we didn&rsquo;t get their approval until now</p></blockquote><h2 id=oh-but-sbe-dev-said-this-was-bannable>Oh, but SBE Dev said this was bannable!!!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#oh-but-sbe-dev-said-this-was-bannable>#</a></h2><p>With the release of SkyblockExtras 2.0.5, the devs of SBE also included an interesting bolded statement.
<img loading=lazy src=images/SBE1.png alt=SBE1>
Seeing as Dungeon Rooms Mod is the only widely used mod that scans the top of the physical map, this is a very pointed statement directed at Dungeon Rooms Mod.
(Just as a note for reference, the Dungeon Rooms Mod scans the top of the map for the sole purpose of detecting what room a player is in.)</p><p>There are a few problems with his statement. First of all, the claim that &ldquo;<em>Admins</em> have also decided&mldr;&rdquo; is not backed up by any public statement by the admins. Based on everything the admins have said publicly, along with all the rules, there is nothing that states that scanning blocks which are not visible to the player is disallowed in any way.</p><p>The second more interesting point, is that the SBE devs narrowed down what was disallowed to just &ldquo;scanning the top of the physical map,&rdquo; not just blocks which are not visible to the player. <strong>They cleverly omitted the fact that SBE scans for blocks (specifically pistons) which are invisible to the player for their water puzzle solver.</strong> If they choose to follow what the admins supposedly told them (and them alone), they should probably also disable their water puzzle solver.</p><p>The SBE dev also clarified on what specifically makes Secret Waypoints bannable.

He claims that it would be &ldquo;less bannable&rdquo; if it could be done using visible blocks.</p><p>Why does where the mod scans for blocks matter? A player who has memorized rooms and secrets can look at a room and easily tell which room it is. Sure, the player can&rsquo;t see the top of the map, but the player can tell just as easily what a particular room is just by looking at the room. It&rsquo;s not like being able to see the top of the map would provide any advantage in being able to tell which room a player is in.</p><p>It was originally more straightforward to implement top of the map scanning for room detection. However, there is a relatively easy way to do room detection without scanning the top of the map. It would take about two weeks to implement, but would result in <strong>no</strong> noticeable difference to the player.</p><p><strong>Does it really matter where the mod scans for blocks if it doesn&rsquo;t affect the end result?</strong> Like seriously, I could spend two weeks of my time recoding the mod to not scan the top of the room and only use visible blocks, but, unless a player looks at the code, they literally wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h2><p>Again, as with all mods on Hypixel, Dungeon Rooms Mod is use at your own risk. But, based on everything listed above, the Secret Waypoints within the Dungeon Rooms Mod are most likely <strong>not</strong> bannable.</p><hr><p><strong>Dungeon Rooms Mod Links:</strong></p><p>Discord: <a href=https://discord.gg/kr2M7WutgJ>https://discord.gg/kr2M7WutgJ</a></p><p>Github: <a href=https://github.com/Quantizr/DungeonRoomsMod>https://github.com/Quantizr/DungeonRoomsMod</a></p><hr><p><em>For the last time, if there are any Hypixel admins reading this who disagree with my interpretation, please message my Discord _risk#2091, or my forums account, so we can discuss.</em><br><em>I am more than happy to change the scanning from top of the map to visible blocks, if you believe that it is necessary.</em></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://quantizr.github.io/posts/how-it-works/><span class=title>« Prev Page</span><br><span>Dungeon Rooms Mod v3.0 - How does it work?</span></a></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://quantizr.github.io/>Quantizr</a></span>
