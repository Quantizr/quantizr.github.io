## Intro
 Dungeon Rooms Mod can be installed in the same way as other Forge mods, by dragging the mod jar into the mod folder.
 
 Follow this guide if you do not understand how to do install the mod. This guide assumes you are using the default Minecraft launcher. If you are using a custom launcher such as MultiMC or ATLauncher, I assume you already know how to install mods. (If you don't know what those two launchers are, don't worry, this doesn't apply to you.)
 
 If you have not already installed Minecraft Forge, continue to the [Prerequisite section](#prerequisite). Otherwise, continue to the installation guide for your specific operating system ([Windows](#windows), [MacOS](#macos) or [Linux](#linux)).

## Prerequisite - Install Minecraft Forge for 1.8.9.
 If you've already installed other 1.8.9 mods, you do **not** have to do this again, continue to the installation guide for your specific operating system ([Windows](#windows), [MacOS](#macos) or [Linux](#linux)).

 If you have not already installed Forge, visit this web page:
 https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html

 Click Installer (either Recommended or Latest is fine, they're the same file for 1.8.9) to download Forge.

 You will get an an adwall, ignore the ad and press the red "Skip" button in the top right.

 You will download a file named `forge-1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9-installer.jar`, once it has finished downloading, run the file. You will see a new window popup called "Mod system installer", make sure "Install client" is the selected option and press "OK"

 Then, load up the Minecraft launcher. You will hopefully see a new profile named forge on the left side of the play button.

 If the new profile des not exist do the following. Press the "Installations" tab near the top of the launcher, followed by the button that says "New installation." You will open a new menu, from there select the dropdown menu underneath version and select `release 1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9` (it might be at the very bottom of the dropdown menu).
